        Any long pasta will work, so use whatever you have in the cupboard.</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>300g Tagliatelle</li>
            <li>20g Salted Butter</li>
            <li>6 Garlic Cloves (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Plain Flour</li>
            <li>150ml Chicken Stock</li>
            <li>200ml Double Cream</li>
            <li>85g Parmesan (grated)</li>
            <li>20g Flat-Leaf Parsley (roughly chopped)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by cooking the pasta following pack instructions. Meanwhile, 
                melt the butter in your largest frying pan. Once foaming, add the 
                garlic and 25 twists of a black pepper mill. Cook for 4-5 mins, 
                until the garlic is light golden and fragrant.</li>
                <li>Stir in the flour to form a paste. Stir for 1-2 mins, 
                    then slowly whisk in the chicken stock until you have 
                    a smooth sauce. Pour in the double cream and sprinkle 
                    in most of the parmesan. Stir until everything is melted
                     and combined, then season to taste.</li>
                     <li>Transfer the pasta straight into the sauce, alongside
                         a good splash of the cooking water. Mix thoroughly, 
                         adding a little more pasta water if necessary, until 
                         you have a thick and glossy sauce.</li>
                         <li>Divide between four bowls and serve topped with 
                            he chopped parsley and remaining parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
